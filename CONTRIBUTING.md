# Contributing

As long as your pull request doesn't break the app in any way or conflict with an ongoing change (check the open issues first or send me [an email](mailto:dev@jfenn.me) to make sure this doesn't happen), it will likely be accepted. I have a lot of projects and may not get around to reviewing pull requests right away. If you have contributed to this project before and would like to be added to this repository as a collaborator, feel free to send me [an email](mailto:dev@jfenn.me) and ask.

## Branches

I don't use branches because I'm lazy. If you want to try to educate me on the glory of having multiple branches to work on, feel free to do so, but at this point in time I can't see them doing anything other than complicating things.
